### Git tracks digital evolution of files

- highlights exactly what changed, line by line
- makes you comment file changes

### Git is your file watchdog.

### Good against: too many files

### Good for: tidy project folders, but...

### Good for: ...version history still accessible

### Version control with Git

#### Technical

- works best for line- or paragraph-based files
- built for source code, but also useful for texts and simple images
- less useful for complex or large file types
- not a substitute for full backups

#### Cultural

- helps build self-explanatory & verifiable project documentation (for your future self, colleagues, students, reviewers...)
- enables less painful collaboration on same set of files
- conflicts only if same lines in same file get changed
- for text files: better than syncing tools

### Basic Git vocabulary: repository/repo

- project folder watched by Git
- is still a normal folder: add, edit & delete files normally
- database of file versions in hidden subfolder

### Basic Git vocabulary: committing

- saving a logical set of file changes in Git, together with meaningful comment
- changes can be within single file, or across different ones
- **commit history:** self-explanatory & verifiable documentation

### Basic Git vocabulary: .gitignore

- file that contains a repo's rules for ignoring files 
- No preview of highlighted changes? Large file? Auto-generated? Rather ignore those!

### Basic Git vocabulary: .gitignore in GitHub for Windows

### Vocabulary summary

#### repository/repo

- project folder watched by Git, plus hidden database of file versions

#### committing

- composing logical set of file changes and meaningful commit message

#### .gitignore

- a repo's ignore rules for non-essential files & file types

### How to start using Git?

1. download client from [windows.github.com](https://windows.github.com/) (any other from [git-scm.com/downloads/guis](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/win)) & install
1. start with small sub-project (protocol optimisation, diagram in R, report, etc.)
1. **besides working on the files themselves:** commit logically connected changes often
1. **recommended:** start writing texts in Markdown[^1] format
1. **optional (for collaboration etc.):** create account with Git hosting service like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) or [GitHub](https://github.com/join)

[^1]: Possible in Word with [Writage](http://www.writage.com/) add-in
